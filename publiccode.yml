    shortDescription: Service to exchange messages with external business partners asynchronously over a REST API in both directions (inbound and outbound).
    longDescription: >
      The Message Exchange Service (MES) is a reusable jEAP-based microservice designed
      for secure, asynchronous file-transfer-style communication between internal systems
      and external business partners. It provides a simple REST API for sending, receiving,
      and retrieving messages, with built-in support for partner-specific roles and tenant
      security. The Message Exchange Service manages message
      storage in databases and S3 object storage, includes configurable housekeeping,
      supports optional fallback buckets, and offers integration with AWS-based malware
      scanning to block infected messages before delivery. It exposes detailed operational
      metrics for HTTP, database, and S3 operations to facilitate monitoring and ensures
      consistent, standardized deployment aligned with other jEAP microservices.
    features:
      - Message exchange API for asynchronous communication with external partners
      - Support for inbound and outbound messages
      - Partner-specific roles and tenant security
      - Configurable housekeeping for message storage
